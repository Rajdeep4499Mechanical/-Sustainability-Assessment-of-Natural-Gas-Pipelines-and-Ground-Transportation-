 Sustainability Assessment of Older Established and Newly Constructed Natural Gas  Pipelines and Ground Transportation  
This project compares older and newer natural gas pipelines (Canadian Mainline vs. NGTL) with road and rail LNG transportation using a sustainability framework. We performed a Streamlined Life Cycle Assessment (SLCA), Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA), and uncertainty analysis. Results showed NGTL and rail transport as the most sustainable options, with up to 70% and 63% efficiency respectively. My contributions included data curation, methodology development, and drafting analysis sections.
